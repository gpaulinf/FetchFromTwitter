# FetchFromTwitter
This repo includes different tools to extract data from Twitter and analyse it using a tone analyser from IBM Watson. 
I developed these tools to fetch images from twitter given a hashtag or user and to extract tweets information and analyse it on IBM Watson's Tone Analyser. I applied the latter to analyse Trump's tweets. 
This is a work in progress
